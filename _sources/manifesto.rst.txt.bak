Chemical Checker Manifesto
==========================

.. epigraph::

    In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the cityâ€™s
    life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses,
    white or black or gray or black-and-white according to whether they
    mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the
    strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them,
    the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings
    and their supports remain.

Chemistry first
'''''''''''''''

The chemical matter has been largely overlooked in the omics era in
favor of sequence molecules such as DNA or proteins. It is time to
praise for small molecules and bring them back to the front-line of
biomedical research.

The small molecule similarity principle simply makes sense
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Similar molecules (tend to) have similar bioactivities. This principle
has been validated recurrently and it is the cornerstone of the CC.

All molecules are equally interesting
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There is an acute research bias towards popular compounds such as
approved drugs. The chemical space is much larger than this.
Understudied molecules need to enter computational drug discovery
pipelines.

Infinite data, finite types of data
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The CC is restricted to a 5x5 organization of data types, and it will
continue like this. Data are constantly released to the public domain,
and it is our duty to keep up to date with the work of others. Despite
the rather fixed organization of the CC, we have room for an unlimited
number of datasets. Dataset are data of a certain type, belonging to one
(or more) particular resource, and treated in a well-defined way.

Others are better curators than us
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The SB&NB *is not* a data curation group, and the CC is not an
integrative database in the strict sense of the word. We trust the work
of others.

It is time to go predictive
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The omics revolution has produced an overwhelming amount of
molecule/phenotype correlations but, most often, these have not been
useful to do prospective predictions. In the CC, we sacrify precise
interpretation in favor of more abstract representations of the data
(signatures), which are easy to plug to machine learning algorithms.

We don't need another chemoinformatics library
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

There are tons of chemoinformatics libraries out there, and some of them
are truly awesome. The CC is mostly about generating biological
signatures, not about reading different types of small molecule formats
or producing images for them.
