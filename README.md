The Chemical Checker (CC) is a resource of small molecule signatures joining the realms of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics. In the CC, compounds are described from multiple viewpoints, spanning every aspect of the drug discovery process, from the mere chemical properties to the clinical outcomes.
