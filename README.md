# Chemical Checker

The Chemical Checker (CC) is a resource of small molecule signatures. In the CC, the realms of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics are unified and compounds are described from multiple viewpoints, spanning every aspect of the drug discovery process, from chemical properties to clinical outcomes.

* For more information about this repositiory, please refer to our [Wiki page](http://gitlab.sbnb.org/project-specific-repositories/chemical_checker/wikis/home).
* For a quick exploration of the resource, please visit the [CC web app](http://chemicalchecker.org).
* Concepts and methods are best described in the original CC publication, [Duran-Frigola et al. 2019](https://www.dropbox.com/s/x2rqszfdfpqdqdy/duranfrigola_etal_ms_current.pdf?dl=0).
