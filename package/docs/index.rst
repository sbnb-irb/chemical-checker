The Chemical Checker repository
===============================

The Chemical Checker (CC) is a data-driven resource of small molecule
bioactivity data. The main goal of the CC is to express data in a format
that can be used off-the-shelf in daily computational drug discovery
tasks. The resource is organized in **5 levels** of increasing
complexity, ranging from the chemical properties of the compounds to
their clinical outcomes. In between, we consider targets, off-targets,
perturbed biological networks and several cell-based assays, including
gene expression, growth inhibition, and morphological profiles. The CC
is different to other integrative compounds database in almost every
aspect. The classical, relational representation of the data is
surpassed here by a less explicit, more machine-learning-friendly
abstraction of the data (see the CC :doc:`Manifesto <manifesto>`).

The CC resource is ever-growing and maintained by the 
`Structural Bioinformatics & Network Biology Laboratory`_ 
at the Institute for
Research in Biomedicine (`IRB Barcelona`_). Should you have any
questions, please send an email to miquel.duran@irbbarcelona.org or
patrick.aloy@irbbarcelona.org.

This project was first presented to the scientific community in the
following paper:  

    Duran-Frigola et al., Extending the small molecule similarity principle to all levels of biology (2019)

and has since
produced a number of :doc:`related publications <pubblications>`.
