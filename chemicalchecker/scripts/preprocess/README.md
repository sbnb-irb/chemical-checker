# Dataset pre-processing

Dataset pre-processing refers to all procedures that must be done to convert downloaded data or molecular properties data to a Signature Type 0 format (`sign0`).

Given the heterogeneity of CC data, dataset pre-processing is dataset-specific. Therefore, **each dataset has its own pre-processing folder** containing pre-processing scripts.

Some commonalities must be accomplished, though:

* A `run.py` file.
